    "## Regression.\n",
    "<p>From wikipedia \" regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors'). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.\n",
    "Most commonly, regression analysis estimates the conditional expectation of the dependent variable given the independent variables â€“ that is, the average value of the dependent variable when the independent variables are fixed. \"<br/>\n",
    "In short what they are saying is if we give you a value X which is independent under certain parameters you can get Y which is dependent.</p>"
